It utilizes the latest technologies, including Express.js, MySQL2, and Sequelize, to create a functional and efficient server-side application. 
The API allows users to perform RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various entities such as categories, products, and tags.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL2
- Sequelize
- dotenv

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the terminal: npm i
3. Set up the database by executing the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder using MySQL shell commands.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables: *see .env.EXAMPLE*
